## Website for crop fertiliser predictions based on nutrients , weather and location
The website is made keeping in mind the need for automation that is required in the field of agriculture and this is done with the help of ML model which
uses fields like current weather, type of crop, pH of the soil to predict the value of nutrients in like Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium in the soil.
# User Interface
The user interface consists of a dashboard that displays the weather, humidity, current pH, cureent levels of NPK in the soil(which we are expected to be input by the sensors located in the farms) along with what should be the optimal level of these nutrients. Moreover, the user is also recommended for irrigation based on weather conditions so that water wastage can be reduced.
